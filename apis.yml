  The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent federal
  agency responsible for investigating transportation accidents, including those
  involving airplanes, trains, ships, and pipelines. The main goal of the NTSB
  is to promote safety and prevent future accidents by conducting thorough
  investigations into the causes of accidents and making recommendations to
  improve safety standards and regulations. The NTSB also issues safety
  recommendations to various transportation agencies and organizations, and
  works closely with industry stakeholders to implement changes that will
  enhance safety in the transportation sector. Additionally, the NTSB provides
  assistance to victims and their families in the aftermath of transportation
  accidents, offering support and guidance throughout the investigative process.
